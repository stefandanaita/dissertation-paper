Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Prof. Fabio Ciravegna for the continuous support and for his patience throughout the project, as well as for motivating me with his useful suggestions.

Secondly, I would like to thank my teammate Bogdan Paul Bujor for his great collaborative spirit and for making this project something I looked forward to work on.

Last, but not least, my sincere thanks go to my family and my girlfriend, for their moral and financial support in the past three years.
